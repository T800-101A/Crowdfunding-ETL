We will work building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, uploading the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

# Step to follow in this project: 

  - A Category DataFrame is Created 

  - A Subcategory DataFrame is Created 

  - A Campaign DataFrame is Created 

  - A Contacts DataFrame is Created

  - A Crowdfunding Database is Created
